# Traveling Salesperson Problem(TSP) with Genetic Algorithm(GA)
 * Created and Organized by Sangryu Park
 * CSCI 4511W - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence at UMN in Spring 2021
 * Reorganized with python in Sep., 2021

## Project Overview
  * Find the minimum cost routes that travel all nodes only once and return to start node
  * Used Genetic Algorithm that inspired from law of biological evolution

## Run
```bash
cd TSP_model
python3 model.py
```

## Dataset
  * five_d.txt: 5 nodes, minimum cost of 19
  * gr17_d.txt: 17 nodes, minimum cost of 2085
  * fri26_d.txt: 26 nodes, minimum cost of 937 
  * dantzig42_d.txt: 42 nodes, minimum cost of 699
  * att48_d.txt: 48 nodes, minimum cost of 33523

## Assumption
  * The GA assumes all nodes are connected one to others
